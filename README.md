## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tandpfun/wardrobe.git
cd wardrobe
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

⚠️ The importer stays disabled until you add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to `.env` and place a PNG reference photo of yourself at `data/model-reference.png`.

Open [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## Import with Codex

This repo includes two Codex skills: one imports clothes and generates modeled item photos; the other styles complete outfits and generates a modeled lookbook.

```text
$import-clothes Import the clothes from ~/Pictures/outfits, create modeled photos, and add them to this wardrobe.
$generate-outfits Create modeled outfit ideas from my wardrobe.
```

Open the cloned repo in Codex and run either prompt. The import skill asks for a local model-reference PNG when needed, reviews every cutout and modeled photo, then writes to `data/library.json` and `data/imported/`. The outfit skill asks how many looks to create, then curates, generates, verifies, and saves the complete collection under `data/`.

Shirts stay in **Tops**. AI prepopulates **Shirt** and **Can wear as a layer** during import: casual flannels and overshirts can qualify, while dress shirts and uncertain cases default to tops only. You can edit these choices; saved manual choices take precedence on reimport. When modeled previews are requested, a layerable shirt gets two images—buttoned as a top and unbuttoned over an inner top—and other pieces get one. Hover over the side-panel photo to reveal arrows, or use the focused carousel's keyboard controls, to browse the pair. Each shirt still counts as one wardrobe item.

For an existing shirt with one accepted modeled photo, save **Shirt** and **Can wear as a layer**, then choose **Create layer look**. Wardrobe keeps the accepted buttoned photo and generates only the missing unbuttoned view for review, without reimporting the shirt.

### For agents

If you are setting up Wardrobe for a user, ask how they want to import their clothes:

- **Codex:** Ask for a folder or camera-roll location and a model-reference PNG, then extract, model, and import the individual pieces by following [the bundled import skill](.agents/skills/import-clothes/SKILL.md). Afterward, offer to create a requested number of modeled looks with [the outfit-generation skill](.agents/skills/generate-outfits/SKILL.md).
- **Web UI:** Help the user configure their own `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `data/model-reference.png`, then let them import through the app.

## What it does

- Detects every garment in a photo with the OpenAI Responses API
- Extracts clean product cutouts with the OpenAI Images API
- Generates optional modeled editorial previews: two for a layerable shirt, one for other pieces
- Keeps originals, jobs, generated images, and the JSON database local in `data/`
- Supports drag, drop, paste, editing, review, regeneration, and approval

## Configuration

| Variable | Default |
| --- | --- |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Required |
| `OPENAI_VISION_MODEL` | `gpt-5.4-mini` |
| `OPENAI_IMAGE_MODEL` | `gpt-image-2` |
| `OPENAI_IMAGE_QUALITY` | `high` |
| `WARDROBE_MODEL_REFERENCE` | `data/model-reference.png` |
| `WARDROBE_MODEL_DIRECTION` | Optional modeled-photo styling direction |
| `WARDROBE_DATA_DIR` | `data` |

If `model-reference-2.png` and `model-reference-3.png` are beside the primary reference, modeled generation uses them for body proportions while the primary reference controls the face.

## Testing

Run `npm test` for integration checks and `npm run check` for the production build. Run `npm run e2e:serve` for a browser test using anonymous fixtures, a local provider, and isolated temporary storage. See [the browser verification report](docs/e2e-verification.md) for reproducible steps, observed results, and screenshots.
